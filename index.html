            ## What is Git?

            Git allows you to have multiple people working on the same code at the same time and offers several tools and methods in order to help resolve conflicts between code changes.

            Git is what is called a VCS or *Version Control System*

            # Project Management and Issues
            ---
            It is important that your team can work efficiently in a short amount of time. That is why laying out your work ahead of time is very important.
            ---
            # Recommendations

            - Start by thinking about the project goals first
            - Have the person with the most knowledge of the tools you will be using setup the initial project
            - Create specific issues that can easily be picked up by anyone
            - Communicate about what you are working on and don't be afraid to ask your teammates and mentors for help!
            ---
            # Issues
            ---
            Issues are a great way to keep track of each other's work, and to not step over each other when everyone is working at the same time.
            ---
            ### An issue should be:
            
            - Concise about the bug or feature
            - Well defined so that anyone can work on it
            - Actionable so that issues don't sit untouched
            
            Everything you need to know to work on an issue should be included in the description of the issue.

            # Branches
            ---
            ![image](images/GitBranches.png)
            ---
            Branches ensure that:
            - You don't accidentally overwrite each other's changes
            - You can easily work on multiple changes at the same time
            - You can easily download updates from the main branch without accidentally overwriting your own changes
            - Others can view your work independantly on the main branch

            ---
            # Write your code! 
            (or download your project files for no-code)

            Make sure you are working in the folder that we got when we cloned the repo.

            # You are done with your change!

            At this point, you should look at finding a new issue to work on.

            # Merge Conflicts
            ---
            Merge conflicts happen when two people make changes to the same lines based off of the same version of the main branch.

            ---
            Sometimes there is a bug introduced by a change, a change wasn't quite ready to be put into the project. Just revert it!
            ---

            ---
            It's as simple as that! Just create your PR and merge it, and your changes will be reverted!
